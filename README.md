### Samples

FoxDot's audio files have been obtained from a number of sources but I've lost record of which files are attributed to which original author. Here's a list of thanks for the unknowing creators of FoxDot's sample archive. 

- [Legowelt Sample Kits](https://awolfe.home.xs4all.nl/samples.html)
- [Game Boy Drum Kit](http://bedroomproducersblog.com/2015/04/08/game-boy-drum-kit/)
- A number of sounds courtesy of Mike Hodnick's live coded album, [Expedition](https://github.com/kindohm/expedition)
- Many samples have been obtained from http://freesound.org and have been placed in the public domain via the Creative Commons 0 License: http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/ - thank you to the original creators
- Other samples have come from the [Dirt Sample Engine](https://github.com/tidalcycles/Dirt-Samples/tree/c2db9a0dc4ffb911febc613cdb9726cae5175223) which is part of the TidalCycles live coding language created by Yaxu - another huge amount of thanks.

If you feel I've used a sample where I shouldn't have, please get it touch!
